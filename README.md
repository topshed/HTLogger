# HTLogger

This Python code is for use with the Astro Pi board. It creates an environmental sensor that logs humidity and temperature readings to file. they are also displayed on the LED matrix according to the orientation of the board as reported by the accelerometer. 

See my [blog] (http://richardhayler.blogspot.com/) for  updates and other Raspberry Pi projects.
